            The starting point of all transformation is this: everything you see, touch, experience, and 
            react to is a direct extension of your <strong className="text-slate-900">own mind</strong>. Not your brain - your mind. This isn't 
            philosophy. This is the very mechanism of reality.

            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
              The brain doesn't imagine from nothing. It recombines what's already familiar. It 
              doesn't see into the future. It looks for patterns from the past. That's why relying on your 
              brain alone keeps you stuck in cycles.

            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
              Your mind is the non-physical field of thought, imagination, attention, and identity. It's 
              the metaphysical space where beliefs are born, and from which all reality is projected. The 
              mind is not inside your skull-it's the field around and beyond your body.

            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
              The mind is not constrained by time or space. You can imagine the future. You can 
              access memories that feel real. You can visualize possibilities that haven't happened yet.

            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
              Your mind is how you connect to God, Source, the Universe, or whatever else you 
              want to call it. It's not separate. It's the same thing. Your mind isn't observing reality-it's 
              shaping and selecting it moment by moment.

            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
              You've been trained to believe God is separate from you, that the Universe is out 
              there somewhere watching and judging. That is the greatest lie ever told. The truth is 
              terrifying to most people: <strong className="text-slate-900">you are it</strong>.

              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-8 text-lg">
                When people say "God", "Source", "the <u>Universe</u>" or "Spirit", they're not 
                wrong. But what they don't realize is that those forces are not separate, external, or 
                higher than them. Those forces are expressions of their <u>own</u> consciousness.
              </p>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-6">Naming</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-8 text-lg">
                The name you give it does not matter. Whether you say Allah, Jesus, Divine 
                Intelligence or Quantum Field, you're always pointing at the same thing: the limitless 
                mind. Your <u>own</u> mind.
              </p>

              <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-6">Mistake</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
                The error is praying TO it instead of FROM it. You keep begging for signs 
                and blessings from something that's already inside you, waiting to be activated.

            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
              When you recognize that your beliefs, emotions <u>and</u> intentions are the 
              Universe's operating commands, you stop asking for miracles and start issuing 
              instructions. You stop pleading and start deciding.
