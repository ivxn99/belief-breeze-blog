            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The brain doesn't imagine from nothing. It recombines what's already familiar. It 
              doesn't see into the future. It looks for patterns from the past. That's why relying on your 
              brain alone keeps you stuck in cycles.

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Your mind is the non-physical field of thought, imagination, attention, and identity. It's 
              the metaphysical space where beliefs are born, and from which all reality is projected. The 
              mind is not inside your skull-it's the field around and beyond your body.

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The mind is not constrained by time or space. You can imagine the future. You can 
              access memories that feel real. You can visualize possibilities that haven't happened yet.

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Your mind is how you connect to God, Source, the Universe, or whatever else you 
              want to call it. It's not separate. It's the same thing. Your mind isn't observing reality-it's 
              shaping and selecting it moment by moment.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mb-6 border-b border-black pb-2">Identity</h2>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              You've been trained to believe God is separate from you, that the Universe is out 
              there somewhere watching and judging. That is the greatest lie ever told. The truth is 
              terrifying to most people: <strong>you are it</strong>.

                <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  When people say "God", "Source", "the Universe" or "Spirit", they're not 
                  wrong. But what they don't realize is that those forces are not separate, external, or 
                  higher than them. Those forces are expressions of their own consciousness.

                <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The name you give it does not matter. Whether you say Allah, Jesus, Divine 
                  Intelligence or Quantum Field, you're always pointing at the same thing: the limitless 
                  mind. Your own mind.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-3">Mistake</h3>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed font-bold">
              The error is praying TO it instead of FROM it. You keep begging for signs 
              and blessings from something that's already inside you, waiting to be activated.

            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              When you recognize that your beliefs, emotions and intentions are the 
              Universe's operating commands, you stop asking for miracles and start issuing 
              instructions.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mb-6 border-b border-black pb-2">Ascension</h2>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Achievements are no longer so elusive to your grasp; they always materialize at precisely the 
              perfect moment. The mechanism that propels this consistent success reveals itself with elegant 
              simplicity:
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4 font-bold">
              the system of excellence is you.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              From this profound simplicity emerges a genuine humility, and the mechanism transcends all 
              logical comprehension. Articulating your triumphs becomes impossible. People will ask you how 
              you do it, and you can never explain it. Not really.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              It sounds ridiculous to state that you suspect the fundamental forces of nature aligning themselves 
              to ensure you win.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4 font-bold">
              You become lucky.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Not as a sly insult to disrespect your efforts. It is literally the case. You keep winning, repeatedly. 
              Again. More.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The fragmented parts of your attention piece themselves together. It is easy to focus for hours. So 
              easy.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The acquisition of knowledge is no longer laborious and taxing; it is natural. Your speech attains 
              newfound eloquence; your written expression manifests crystalline clarity, your diction ever so 
              succulent and smooth. Liquid silk. Confidence.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The need to impress others dissolves; <strong>you simply are impressive</strong>.
